                <h1> The Start:</h1>
                <strong><small>I am a 38 year old who loves tech! I have liked technology 
                    since I was in elementary school. </small></strong>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In fact, my dream job back in the 1990's was to work for Microsoft.
                    I have a little bit of college experience with computer science. 
                    I went to DeVry University from 2008 to 2011. 
                    I majored in Computer information Systems with an emphasis on cybersecurity. 
                    I did not complete the program due to financial issues. 
                    It is a point of my life that I regret not finishing.</p>

                <h1> What brought me to CodingTemple?</h1>
                <strong><small>Technology is always evolving!</small></strong>
                <figure>
                    <img id="main-pictures-left" src="images/HMKPic-07.jpg">

                </figure>
                    <p> I came to CodingTemple because I wanted to FINALLY finish the goals that 
                        I had in 2008 at DeVry: 
                        land a good career in a field that I have been interested in my whole life! 
                        From 2011 to now, I have worked jobs that I did not 
                        enjoy just to make ends meet and to get by.</p>

            <article class="main-articles">
                <h1> Career Change:</h1>
                <strong><small>I've always felt like a hamster in a hamster cage 
                    spinning around in circles when it came to jobs. </small></strong>
                    <figure>
                        <img id= "main-pictures-left" src="images/IMG_7695.jpg">
                        <figcaption>
                            A picture I took while taking a hike.
                        </fig>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I worked jobs because I had to in order to survive, 
                        but I didn't enjoy any of them. 
                        This past January, I first saw an ad on Instagram about CodingTemple. 
                        I clicked it, read through it, and closed it. 
                        I didn't think the program was real - meaning I felt like it was another version of DeVry. 
                        The biggest reason why I didn't finish DeVry is because I ran out of financial aid. 
                        On top of that, DeVry used false information when it came to the 
                        percentage of graduates that got jobs with their programs.</p>

            <!--Article 3 About Me-->
            <article class="main-articles">
                <h1> Taking The Risk:</h1>
                <strong><small>My motto throughout my life has been "Take the risk or 
                    lose the chance". </small></strong>
                    <figure>
                        <img id="main-pictures-left" src="images/IMG_7731.jpg">

                            Taking the harder path has its rewards.
                        </fig>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Again, when I saw the Instagram ad for CodingTemple, I thought it would be another 
                        version of DeVry but something about the program was tugging at my heart strings. 
                        When I quit my last job at the beginning of June, 
                        I knew that whereever I was going to work next was going to be the start of a career 
                        for me because I am tired of feeling unfulfilled when it comes to a job. 
                        It was at that point I decided to give CodingTemple a go. 
                        It is another financial investment that I am going to have to commit to but
                         it's one that I feel is necessary for me to be where I want to be in order 
                         to live my best life.</p>
